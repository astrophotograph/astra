# Self-hosting the Astra daemon

The hosted Astra service is the desktop backend running as a daemon
(`astra_daemon`, an axum HTTP server over the same SQLite + HoardFS stack),
typically exposed through a Cloudflare Tunnel so no inbound ports are
opened. This doc describes the generic shape; operator-specific
configuration (real unit files, hostnames, network layout) belongs in your
own private infrastructure repo, not here.

## Topology

```
browser ──► Cloudflare edge (your domain, proxied CNAME)
                │
                ▼
        cloudflared tunnel                       (astra-tunnel.service)
                │  /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
                ▼
        astra_daemon on 127.0.0.1:27872          (astra-daemon.service)
                │
                ▼
        $ASTRA_DATA_DIR  (astra.db + hoardfs/ + web/)
```

Run both as **system units under dedicated non-login users** (`astra`,
`cloudflared`) — never as your login user for an internet-facing service.
The templates in `deploy/` carry a full systemd hardening block
(ProtectSystem=strict, NoNewPrivileges, syscall filter, empty capability
set); start from those. For extra isolation, run the whole pair inside a
dedicated VM with egress filtering so a compromise can't move laterally.

## Daemon requirements

- The binary is nearly static (libc/libm/libgcc only — the Python bridge
  is desktop-only and links out), so building on a glibc-compatible host
  and copying the binary works.
- `ASTRA_DATA_DIR` must be writable by the `astra` user; the web bundle
  is served from `$ASTRA_DATA_DIR/web` and must exist **at startup** for
  the `/` and `/app` routes to mount.
- If your library references original files by absolute path (external
  refs), those paths must resolve wherever the daemon runs — mount them
  read-only.
- OIDC (`ASTRA_OIDC_ISSUER` + `ASTRA_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, a public PKCE SPA
  client) enables browser sessions; without it only personal access
  tokens (`astra_daemon --mint-token`) authenticate. JWT validation needs
  a sane clock — enable systemd-timesyncd in minimal VM images.

## Public surface

| Route | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/healthz` | none | version + db/hoardfs status |
| `/@user`, `/@user/slug`, assets | none | published collections only |
| `/api/*` | bearer (PAT or OIDC JWT) | default-deny |

## Deploying

`just deploy-staging` builds the release daemon + web bundle and pushes
them into the maintainer's staging VM (Incus), swapping the binary via
push-to-temp + rename (overwriting a running binary in place fails with
"text file busy"). Unit files are pushed from `$ASTRA_DEPLOY_DIR`
(default `deploy/`), so real, environment-specific units can live outside
the repo — set it in a gitignored `.env`.

```bash
just deploy-staging   # build → push binary/web/units → restart → healthz
just daemon-status    # unit status inside the VM
just daemon-logs      # follow both journals
```
